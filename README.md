# Base Serverless Framework Template

My forked version of [Ariel Weinberger sls base template](https://github.com/arielweinberger/sls-base)

## What's included
* Small and consistent folder structure for your projects.
* [serverless-bundle plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serverless-bundle): Bundler based on the serverless-webpack plugin - requires zero configuration and fully compatible with ES6/ES7 features.

## Getting started
```
sls create --name YOUR_PROJECT_NAME --template-url https://github.com/devmata/sls-base
cd YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
npm install
```

You are ready to go!
